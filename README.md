#SubEditor
Spaghetti-coded application for editing subtitles' timing. Edit any line's timing of a subtitle and SubEditor will relatively change timing of the rest of the lines from the edited line.

##How To Use
1. Open a subtitle file(.srt) with SubEditor.
2. Edit any line's timing and Edit -> Refactor (âŒ˜ + R) to update the rest of the file.
3. Save

##Warning
- You **can not** edit anything other than timings.
- You must edit timing with the correct format.
- This application probably work in OS X only. *I don't know.*
- The source code doesn't contain any comment.
